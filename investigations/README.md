# Investigations

This is a directory for storing thoughts and programmatic exploration of the ciphers.

Normally, a notebook would make sense but raw python files are easier to work with
for me in neovim.

## Execution

Each investigation python file expects the root of the git repo to be in `PYTHONPATH`.
